# The constant-time compares on x86_64

`low::generic::ct_equal` compares two slices through `ct_compare_16`, for
16-byte ones, or `ct_compare_bytes`. Their `asm!` blocks are proven in HOL
Light, of the bytes rind's build emits, in `proofs/hol-light/x86_64/`, and
each axiom here restates one of those theorems, at rind's commit, about the
opaque Rust wrapper around the block. The restatement, and that the wrapper
passes the arguments the theorem names, are trusted. Each file's `_SAFE`
theorem proves the block's loads and branches depend only on the
addresses and lengths, which no Lean theorem states. `admin/prove` writes
the aarch64 proof from this file by renaming the target.
