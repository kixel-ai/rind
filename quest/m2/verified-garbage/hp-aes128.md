# [S] AES-128 header protection on Haswell runs pyca/verified-garbage's code where it is faster

## Goal

On each tier below where pyca/verified-garbage (VG) measured at least as fast as rind at every size, AES-128 QUIC header protection on AVX2 CPUs without VAES runs VG's routine under rind's glue and behavior.

## Plan

- Measured in [run 43531095881](https://github.com/kixel-ai/rind/actions/runs/43531095881) (the nightly `bench` workflow dispatched on [kixel-ai/rind#741](https://github.com/kixel-ai/rind/pull/741) at VG `d004ffae`) and on the report's hosts, as [the epic](/quest/m2/verified-garbage/README.md) records. Ratios are VG's time over rind's.
- Take VG's lowest routine that leaves rind's API and behavior intact and keep rind's glue, as the epic's Plan settles. Vendor it with `admin/import-vg`, which the first switch to land adds.
- Re-measure each cell below before and after on the nightly's tiers and an idle host, and switch only the cells that still hold at every size; every other tier keeps rind's code.
- Wycheproof and the aws-lc-rs differential tests already cover the operation; extend the ctgrind tests to the new code path.

Cells VG won:

- The Haswell VPSes: 0.92 (`ovh-iad`) and 0.96 (`ovh-sea`), one block, about 4 ns.
- Lost everywhere else (1.12 to 1.35), including AES-256 on the same hosts (1.05). Recheck on more AVX2 CPUs without VAES before switching: no nightly tier is one.
