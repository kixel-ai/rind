# [XL] x86_64's dual RSAZ IFMA exponentiation is proven

## Goal

On x86_64 CPUs with AVX-512 IFMA (Ice Lake and later, Zen 4 and later), where both CRT exponentiations run at once by aws-lc's dual RSAZ, RSA signing and decryption for 2048-, 3072-, and 4096-bit keys earn the ✓.

## Plan

- Runs (`low/x86_64/rsaz_avx512.rs`): `rsaz_amm52x{20,30,40}_x2_ifma256`, almost-Montgomery products over 52-bit limbs two moduli at a time, and `extract_multiplier_2x{20,30,40}_win5`, gathering by masking all 32 window entries, under rind's Rust port of aws-lc's driving C.
- Route: add AVX-512F, AVX-512VL, and IFMA (`vpmadd52luq`, `vpmadd52huq`, opmask registers) to s2n-bignum's x86_64 model, prove the routines against an almost-Montgomery specification, and prove the Rust driver with Aeneas.
- Taking the proven Karatsuba path on IFMA hosts instead is not a route unless it measures as fast.
- Upstream: offering this work to awslabs/s2n-bignum is optional, and there is no standing approval: stop and ask the maintainer before posting there or anywhere outside the moq-dev and kixelated orgs (decided with the maintainer on 2026-11-07 on [kixel-ai/rind#448](https://github.com/kixel-ai/rind/pull/448)).

## Required

- [RSA signing, decryption, and key generation are proven](/quest/m4/verified/rsa-sign.md) - the CRT glue this exponentiation slots into
- [RSA on AVX-512 runs pyca/verified-garbage's code where it is faster](/quest/m2/verified-garbage/rsa-avx512.md) - VG measured 0.96 to 0.99 of the dual RSAZ's time; delete this quest if that switch lands, and drop this link if it doesn't
