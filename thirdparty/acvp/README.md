# ACVP sample vector sets

Sample vector sets from NIST's [ACVP-Server] (`gen-val/json-files/`), the
known-answer sets of the Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol that
replaced CAVP. Each file is a set's `internalProjection.json`, which holds
its prompts and their answers together.

`admin/sync-acvp` fetches them from the revision it pins, v1.1.0.43
(2026-08-12), and changes them as follows: it keeps only the test groups and
tests whose parameters rind offers, as its filters list, and drops SP
800-106's randomized-hashing groups and messages that are not a whole number
of bytes. To update, bump the revision in
`admin/sync-acvp` and rerun it. The tests that read a set fail on any group
they do not expect, so the script's filters are the only place a test is
skipped.

These are samples whose answers NIST publishes. Passing them is not a
validation: that answers fresh sets from NIST's ACVP server.

The changes: on 2026-11-09, rind trimmed each set to the groups and tests
it runs, as above. Source: National Institute of Standards and Technology,
